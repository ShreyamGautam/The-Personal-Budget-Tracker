# Expense Tracker - A Full-Stack MERN Application

This is a comprehensive personal finance and budget tracking application designed to help users manage their income, expenses, and budgets effectively. Built from the ground up with the MERN stack, this application provides a clean, responsive user interface and a powerful, secure backend. It supports both individual financial tracking and collaborative group expense management.

## ‚ú® Features

We have built a rich set of features to provide a complete user experience:

### Core Personal Finance

  * **Transaction Management:** Full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality for both income and expense entries.
**Dynamic Dashboard:** An at-a-glance view of your complete financial status, including total balance, income, expenses, recent transactions, and visual charts. 
**Budget Management:** Set monthly budgets for different categories, track your spending with real-time progress bars, and get visual alerts when you overspend. 
  * **Data Visualization:** Interactive and dynamic charts on every page.
      * **Bar charts** to show monthly income trends.
      * **Line charts** to show monthly expense trends. 
      * **Donut charts** for a financial overview and category-wise breakdowns. 
  * **Advanced Filtering & Search:** Easily find transactions with a real-time search bar and advanced filters for categories and date ranges. 
  * **PDF Reports:** Download your income or expense history as a formatted PDF document.

### User & Group Management

  * **Secure User Authentication:** Complete user registration and login system using JWT for security.  Pages are protected, and data is private to each user.
  * **Personalized Profile:** Users can upload and update their own profile pictures, and their name is displayed throughout the app.
  * **Group Expense Management (Splitwise Clone):**
      * Create groups for shared activities (e.g., trips, roommates).
      * Add or remove members from groups.
      * Add shared expenses and split them equally or unequally .

      * **Mongoose:** As the Object Data Modeling (ODM) library to interact with MongoDB.
  * **Authentication & Security:**
      * **JSON Web Tokens (JWT):** For securing API endpoints and managing user sessions.
      * **bcrypt.js:** For hashing passwords before storing them in the database.
